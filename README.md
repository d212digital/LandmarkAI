# LandmarkAI

Created a WPF Ai app that will allow you to upload images to a trained model using CustomVision.ai I have trained the model on 3 major landmarks 

Golden Gate Brige
Eiffel Tower
Kukulcan

This simple app tests the API And the AI by allowing users to upload an image, and getting back the probabilty % of identification.
